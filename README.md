# Java Basics Repository

This repository contains a collection of fundamental Java programs covering a wide range of topics and concepts. These programs serve as learning resources for Java beginners and provide examples of common Java programming constructs.

## Program List

- **Calculator**: A simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations.
- **Constructor Overloading**: Demonstrates how to create multiple constructors with different parameter lists in a class.
- **Command Line Argument**: Shows how to accept command-line arguments in a Java program.
- **Default Constructor**: Explains the concept of a default constructor in Java.
- **Factorial**: Calculates and prints the factorial of a given number.
- **Fibonacci Series**: Generates and displays the Fibonacci series up to a specified limit.
- **Final and Finalize**: Illustrates the use of the `final` keyword for variables, methods, and classes, as well as the `finalize()` method for object cleanup.
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Demonstrates hierarchical inheritance, where multiple classes inherit from a common base class.
- **Instance Initialization Block (IIB)**: Explains the Instance Initialization Block, a block of code executed before constructors.
- **Java Basics**: Covers the basic structure of a Java program, including class definition, main method, and printing to the console.
- **Method Overloading**: Shows how to overload methods by creating multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
- **Non-Regular Array**: Introduces arrays in Java and demonstrates how to create non-regular (jagged) arrays.
- **Pattern**: Displays various patterns using loops and asterisks.
- **Reverse**: Reverses a given string or number.
- **Static**: Explains the `static` keyword and demonstrates its usage for variables and methods.
- **Vowel Checker**: Determines whether a given character is a vowel or not.

## Running the Programs

Each program is self-contained and can be run independently. Follow these general steps to run a Java program:

1. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

2. Navigate to the program's directory.

3. Compile the program (replace `ProgramName.java` with the actual program's filename):

   ```bash
   javac ProgramName.java
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   java ProgramName
   ```

Replace `ProgramName` with the name of the Java file you want to execute.
